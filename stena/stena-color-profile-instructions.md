The blue, red and white colour combination is an iconic Stena Line feature. It has been part of our visual expression for almost 60 years. These colours represent a strong visual foundation for our brand to build from and why blue and red should be dominant in all our communication together with the white or black text colour to secure accessibility.

Secondary colours

To support our primary colours, we have a range of secondary colours available, each with its unique purpose.

Beige

Beige function as a text box colour e.g. on the website, a digital newsletter or Powerpoint presentation. However white is our standard background colour and is used in most cases.

Light blue and pink

When creating Powerpoint presentations, light blue and pink are also possible to use. Light blue as it is a nuance shade of our Core blue, and Pink as a nuance shade of our Core red. To be able to show a chart or diagram containing several colours, as well as layout text boxes with different backgrounds in a grid, light blue, pink and beige can be combined together. Please note, light blue or pink should not be used in any of our external communication.

Green

Green has its very precise usage and is only seen related to our "Better Choice" communication.

Blue

The secondary colour blue (not to be confused with our Core blue), is used to highlight links online.

Yellow

Yellow is only used to communicate Easter.
