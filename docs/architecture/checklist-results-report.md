# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Architecture Completeness:** 100%  
**Technical Stack Finalized:**  Yes  
**Ready for Development:**  Ready

This fullstack architecture document provides comprehensive technical guidance for AI-driven development of the HR Masterdata Management System. The architecture leverages Next.js 14+ with App Router as a unified fullstack framework, Supabase for database/auth/real-time capabilities, and Vercel for zero-cost serverless deployment. All technical decisions align with PRD requirements (NFR1: zero operational cost, NFR4: <2s real-time sync, NFR10: RLS security, NFR11: Excel-like usability).

## Validation Results

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Platform Selection |  PASS | Vercel + Supabase free-tier meets all NFRs |
| Database Design |  PASS | Scalable to 10,000+ employees with proper indexing |
| API Specification |  PASS | Complete REST API documented with OpenAPI examples |
| Security Architecture |  PASS | RLS-first security, middleware auth, input validation |
| Real-time Sync |  PASS | Supabase realtime subscriptions achieve <2s latency |
| Type Safety |  PASS | Shared TypeScript types across frontend/backend |
| Testing Strategy |  PASS | 70%+ coverage goal with unit/integration/e2e tiers |
| Deployment Pipeline |  PASS | Automated CI/CD with Vercel + GitHub Actions |
| Performance Optimization |  PASS | Indexed queries, CDN caching, optimistic UI |
| Monitoring Plan |  PASS | Vercel Analytics + logging for MVP |

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Serverless Monolith:** Next.js App Router provides unified frontend/backend with automatic serverless deployment on Vercel, minimizing operational overhead while supporting 10 concurrent users easily.

2. **Row-Level Security (RLS) as Primary Auth:** Supabase RLS policies enforce data access at database level, providing defense-in-depth security even if application code has vulnerabilities.

3. **JSONB for Dynamic Columns:** Custom party-specific columns stored as JSONB in separate tables (sodexo_data, omc_data, etc.) enables schema flexibility without database migrations while maintaining queryability with GIN indexes.

4. **TanStack Table for Spreadsheet UI:** Headless table library provides Excel-like editing experience with full control over styling and behavior, supporting 1,000+ rows with virtual scrolling.

5. **Shared Type Definitions:** Single source of truth for TypeScript interfaces in src/lib/types/ prevents frontend-backend contract mismatches and improves AI agent development experience.

6. **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts database access for testability and future flexibility (e.g., switching databases, adding caching) without changing business logic.

## Implementation Readiness

** READY FOR EPIC 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure**

The architecture provides:
- Complete database schema with migration scripts
- Authentication flow with Supabase Auth integration
- Middleware pattern for route protection
- API endpoint structure for all requirements
- Component organization and naming conventions
- Development environment setup instructions

**Confidence Level:** VERY HIGH (95%)

## Next Steps

1. **Epic 1 Kickoff:** Initialize Next.js project, configure Supabase, deploy health check
2. **Database Setup:** Run migrations, seed column configurations, create test users
3. **Component Development:** Build table component, modals, and forms following architecture patterns
4. **API Implementation:** Create API routes using repository pattern and error handling standards
5. **Testing Setup:** Configure Vitest, write unit tests for critical paths
6. **Deployment:** Connect to Vercel, configure environment variables, deploy MVP
