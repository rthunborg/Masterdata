# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the HR Masterdata Management System, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield Project**

This is a greenfield project built on the **Next.js App Router** framework with **Supabase** backend. We'll leverage Next.js as both a fullstack framework (frontend + API routes) rather than using a pre-built starter template, as the PRD has specific requirements that benefit from custom implementation.

**Framework Choices:**
- **Next.js 14+** with App Router for unified frontend/backend development
- **Supabase** for database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage
- **Vercel** for deployment (zero-cost tier)
