# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 98%  
**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right  
**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** ✅ Ready

The PRD successfully captures all essential requirements for the HR Masterdata Management System MVP. It provides clear problem definition, well-scoped features across 5 epics and 22 user stories, comprehensive technical guidance, and detailed acceptance criteria. The requirements are testable, appropriately sized for incremental delivery, and ready for architectural design. Recent updates have added employee termination tracking and CSV import functionality based on actual data structure requirements.

## Key Strengths

- **Clear Value Proposition**: Solving real pain points (Excel fragility, access control, data sync)
- **User-Centric Design**: Two well-defined personas with specific needs addressed
- **Measurable Success**: Quantified goals (70% time reduction, <2s latency, 100% adoption)
- **Technical Clarity**: Specific stack (Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, TypeScript)
- **Proper Sequencing**: Epics build logically from foundation → core features → advanced capabilities
- **Story Sizing**: Right-sized for AI agent execution (2-4 hour vertical slices)
- **Testability**: Local CLI testability required in acceptance criteria
- **Complete Data Model**: Aligned with actual CSV structure from existing system

## Updates in v0.2

1. ✅ **Added Story 2.5**: Mark Employee as Terminated/Drop Out - Track terminations separately with date and reason
2. ✅ **Added Story 2.6**: Import Employees from CSV File - Bulk import from existing Excel data with column mapping
3. ✅ **Updated Database Schema**: Added first_name, surname, mobile, town_district, is_terminated, termination_date, termination_reason, comments fields
4. ✅ **Updated FR5a & FR5b**: Added functional requirements for termination tracking and CSV import

## Updates in v0.3

1. ✅ **Added Story 2.8**: Important Dates Reference Calendar - Shared operational calendar with week numbers and key dates
2. ✅ **Updated Database Schema**: Added important_dates table with week_number, year, category, date_description, date_value
3. ✅ **Updated FR5c**: Added functional requirement for important dates calendar maintenance
4. ✅ **Field Name Alignment**: Updated all references to match actual data structure (First Name, Surname, Mobile, etc.)

## Recommendations (Non-Blocking)

**Low Priority:**

1. Clarify in FR14/Epic 4 that external parties can create their own columns (currently implied in Story 4.2)
2. Document interim password reset approach (HR manually resets via admin panel)
3. Specify target performance benchmark numbers in Story 5.5 (currently "acceptable" - could define specific metrics)

## Final Assessment

**✅ READY FOR UX EXPERT & ARCHITECT**

The PRD provides an excellent foundation for UX and architectural design. Requirements are clear, comprehensive, and appropriately scoped for 8-12 week MVP delivery. All critical recommendations have been addressed including data migration strategy and termination tracking.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (98%)
