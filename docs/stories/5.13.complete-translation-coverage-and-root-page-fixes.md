## Story

**As a** Swedish-speaking user,  
**I want** all UI text to be fully translated and the root page to be Swedish-only,  
**so that** the system feels native and professional in my language.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Root Page Redesign (Swedish-Only)**
   - Root page (`/page.tsx`) should NOT use locale routing (no redirect to `/en` or `/sv`)
   - All content on root page in Swedish only
   - App title: "Stena Line Säsongsrekrytering" (not "HR Masterdata Management System")
   - Description: Concise, focused on capabilities (max 2-3 sentences)
   - Remove all third-party company mentions (Sodexo, Bluegarden, Silkeborg Forsyning)
   - Keep "Logga in till systemet" button (Swedish)

2. **Navigation Links Translation**
   - Dashboard layout sidebar links translated:
     - "Employees" → "Anställda" (Swedish) / "Employees" (English)
     - "Important Dates" → "Viktiga datum" (Swedish) / "Important Dates" (English)

3. **Employee Table Empty State**
   - "No employees found. Click 'Add Employee' to create your first record." → Fully translated

4. **Important Dates Page Translations**
   - Page description paragraph (remove "ÖMC" third-party reference)
   - Subtitle paragraph fully translated
   - Table headers: "Week Number", "Year", "Category" → Translated
   - Filter label: "Filter by Category" → Translated
   - Dropdown option: "All categories" → Translated
   - Empty state: "No important dates found." → Translated

5. **Admin Users Page Translations**
   - Description paragraph fully translated
   - Table headers: "Role", "Created", "Actions" → Translated
   - Button: "Deactivate" → Translated

6. **Admin Columns Page Translations**
   - Form label: "Column Name" → Translated
   - (Note: Most admin columns page was fixed in Story 5.9.1 ✅)

7. **Translation File Completeness**
   - All missing translation keys added to `messages/en.json` and `messages/sv.json`
   - No hardcoded English strings remain in Swedish locale
   - Translation key audit completed across all `.tsx` files

8. **Third-Party References Removed**
   - No mentions of "Sodexo", "Bluegarden", "Silkeborg Forsyning", "ÖMC" in user-facing text
   - Generic references used where needed (e.g., "external partners" if necessary)

## Background

**User Feedback (UAT Discovery):**

After Story 5.9 and 5.9.1 deployment, user testing revealed:

1. Root page redirects to `/en` when it should be Swedish-only
2. ~20 hardcoded English strings throughout the application
3. Third-party company names mentioned in user-facing text

**Quote from User:**

> "When I go to our root page, I get routed to /en. I want our root page to not have a language route and be in Swedish always. So rewrite the root text to be in Swedish and shorten it a lot. Just describe the apps capabilities, don't mention specific companies that are third party. And call it something along Stena Line Säsongsrekrytering."

> "I also noticed this text is not translated to Swedish 'No employees found. Click 'Add Employee' to create your first record.' as well as the link names 'Employees, Important Dates' etc..."

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: EXCELLENT** ✓

This story represents exemplary implementation quality across all dimensions. The developer demonstrated systematic execution of a comprehensive i18n migration with complete requirements traceability, automated test coverage, and adherence to architectural patterns.

**Strengths:**

- **Complete Requirements Coverage**: All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated
- **Test-First Approach**: Comprehensive test suite created (translation completeness, third-party references, root page content)
- **Zero Technical Debt**: No shortcuts, no hardcoded strings remaining
- **Build Verification**: Clean build with no TypeScript errors
- **Documentation**: Excellent Dev Agent Record with clear file listing and completion notes

**Architecture Alignment:**

- Proper use of next-intl translation hooks (`useTranslations`, `getTranslations`)
- Consistent namespace organization in translation files
- Server-side translation support in layouts using `getTranslations({ locale, namespace })`
- All changes follow established coding standards

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring was necessary.** The implementation was clean, idiomatic, and production-ready as delivered.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS
  - Proper use of translation hooks
  - Consistent naming conventions
  - Type-safe implementation
- **Project Structure**: ✓ PASS
  - Translation files properly organized in `messages/` directory
  - Tests organized in appropriate `tests/unit/i18n/` and `tests/unit/pages/` directories
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ PASS
  - Unit tests for translation completeness
  - Unit tests for third-party references
  - Unit tests for root page content
  - All tests passing (651 total tests across entire suite)
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ PASS
  - AC1: Root page redesigned (Swedish-only, no locale routing) ✓
  - AC2: Navigation links translated ✓
  - AC3: Employee table empty state translated ✓
  - AC4: Important dates page translations ✓
  - AC5: Admin users page translations ✓
  - AC6: Admin columns page translations ✓
  - AC7: Translation file completeness ✓
  - AC8: Third-party references removed ✓

### Improvements Checklist

All improvements were handled by the developer. No additional work required.

- [x] Root page rewritten in Swedish (src/app/page.tsx)
- [x] All 16 translation keys added to both en.json and sv.json
- [x] All 8 components updated to use translation keys
- [x] Test suite created and passing
- [x] Build verification successful
- [x] Third-party references eliminated

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** ✓

No security concerns. This story focused on UI text localization and did not modify:

- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization logic
- Data access patterns
- API routes
- Database queries

All changes are presentation-layer only using established next-intl patterns.

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** ✓

No performance impact. Translation keys are statically loaded and cached by next-intl. The implementation follows best practices:

- Server-side translations in layouts using `getTranslations`
- Client-side translations in components using `useTranslations`
- No dynamic translation file loading
- No additional network requests

Bundle size impact is negligible (16 additional translation keys ≈ 1KB).

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

#### Maintainability

**Status: PASS** ✓

- Translation keys follow consistent naming pattern (`namespace.key`)
- Test coverage ensures translation completeness is maintained
- Automated tests prevent regression

#### Usability

**Status: PASS** ✓

- Swedish users now have fully localized experience
- Root page is Swedish-only as requested
- No third-party company names in user-facing text
- Professional, concise messaging

#### Internationalization

**Status: PASS** ✓

- Proper i18n architecture using next-intl
- Translation key parity enforced by automated tests
- Scalable for future language additions
