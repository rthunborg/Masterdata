# Story 5.6: Remove System Health Button from Root Page

## Status

**Done**

---

## Story

**As a** user visiting the root page,  
**I want** a clean landing page without technical links,  
**so that** the interface is focused on core actions (login).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Remove "System Health" button from `src/app/page.tsx`
2. Remove or update associated test in `tests/unit/pages/landing-page.test.tsx` to verify button is NOT present
3. Keep `/api/health` endpoint functional for monitoring (just remove UI link)
4. Update UI to have single primary CTA: "Login to System"
5. Verify landing page still loads correctly with simplified UI

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

[Source: Epic 5.5 Definition - docs/prd/epic-5.5-post-mvp-polish-branding.md]

This is the **first story in Epic 5.5: Post-MVP Polish & Branding**. Epic 5.5 addresses user feedback-driven enhancements and applies Stena Line branding to polish the MVP for production deployment.

**Epic Goal**: Apply user feedback-driven enhancements and Stena Line branding to polish the MVP for production deployment. This includes UX improvements (fixing redirect delays, adding tooltips, improving header navigation), bilingual support (Swedish/English), SSN input flexibility, and comprehensive Stena Line visual identity implementation.

**Story Purpose**: Remove technical "System Health" button from root page to create a cleaner, more user-focused landing page. The health endpoint remains accessible for monitoring but is hidden from end users.

**Story Dependencies**: None - this is a standalone UX improvement

**Epic Story Priority Order**:

1. Story 5.12 (Stena Branding) - Highest priority for deployment credibility
2. Story 5.8 (Sign-out in Header) - Important UX improvement
3. Story 5.7 (Fix Login Redirect) - Annoying bug, high visibility
4. **Story 5.6 (Remove System Health Button)** - Quick win, 30 min
5. Story 5.9 (Language Toggle) - Important for Swedish users
6. Story 5.10 (Tooltips) - Nice-to-have UX polish
7. Story 5.11 (SSN Auto-Format) - Convenience feature

### Previous Story Context

[Source: Story 5.5 Completion Notes - docs/stories/5.5.mvp-smoke-test-documentation.md]

**Story 5.5 Established**:

- Comprehensive documentation for MVP
- USER_GUIDE.md created (795 lines)
- API_DOCUMENTATION.md created (1553 lines)
- Test pass rate: 97.0% (584/602 tests passing)
- MVP ready for UAT pending smoke test execution

**Key Learnings**:

- Documentation should be user-friendly for non-technical audience
- All changes should maintain or improve test pass rate (target: >95%)
- Visual changes should be responsive (desktop + mobile)

### Architecture Context

[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**File Locations**:

```
src/
  app/
    page.tsx                          # UPDATE - Remove System Health button
tests/
  unit/
    pages/
      landing-page.test.tsx           # UPDATE or CREATE - Test button is NOT present
```

**Current Landing Page Structure** (from `src/app/page.tsx`):

```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col gap-3 pt-2 sm:flex-row">
  <Link href="/login" className="flex-1">
    <Button className="w-full" size="lg">
      Login to System
    </Button>
  </Link>
  <Link href="/api/health" target="_blank" className="flex-1">
    <Button variant="outline" className="w-full" size="lg">
      System Health
    </Button>
  </Link>
</div>
```

**Target Structure** (after button removal):

```tsx
<div className="flex justify-center pt-2">
  <Link href="/login" className="w-full sm:w-auto">
    <Button className="w-full sm:w-auto px-12" size="lg">
      Login to System
    </Button>
  </Link>
</div>
```

**Health Endpoint Verification**:

- File: `src/app/api/health/route.ts`
- Endpoint: `GET /api/health`
- No changes required - endpoint remains functional for monitoring
- Used by deployment health checks and monitoring tools

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements**:

**Frontend Component Tests**:

- Test file location: `tests/unit/pages/landing-page.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Test coverage goal: 60%+ for UI components

**Example Test Pattern**:

```typescript
// tests/unit/pages/landing-page.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import Home from '@/app/page';

describe('Landing Page', () => {
  it('renders Login to System button', () => {
    render(<Home />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: /Login to System/i })).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('does NOT render System Health button', () => {
    render(<Home />);
    expect(screen.queryByRole('link', { name: /System Health/i })).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('renders page heading', () => {
    render(<Home />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })).toHaveTextContent(/HR Masterdata Management System/i);
  });

  it('renders system description', () => {
    render(<Home />);
    expect(screen.getByText(/Centralized employee data management platform/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**Test Execution**:

- Run tests: `npm test` or `pnpm test`
- Watch mode: `npm test -- --watch`
- Single file: `npm test landing-page.test.tsx`

### Responsive Design Considerations

**Desktop (sm: breakpoint and above)**:

- Button should be centered with auto width
- Padding: `px-12` for comfortable click target
- Size: `size="lg"` for prominence

**Mobile (below sm: breakpoint)**:

- Button should be full-width: `w-full`
- Maintains `size="lg"` for easy touch target
- Card padding ensures proper margins

**Layout Classes**:

- Container: `flex justify-center pt-2` (centers button horizontally)
- Link: `w-full sm:w-auto` (full-width mobile, auto desktop)
- Button: `w-full sm:w-auto px-12` (full-width mobile, padded desktop)

### Visual Design Standards

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md - Frontend Standards]

**Component Styling**:

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes (no custom CSS unless necessary)
- Use shadcn/ui Button component variants
- Primary actions: `Button` (default variant)
- Secondary actions: `Button variant="outline"`

**Spacing**:

- Consistent spacing using Tailwind scale: `gap-3`, `pt-2`, `px-12`
- Card padding: `p-8 md:p-12` (unchanged)

**Typography**:

- Heading: `text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight`
- Description: `text-lg text-zinc-600`
- Metadata: `text-xs text-zinc-500`

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Organization**:

```
tests/
  unit/
    pages/
      landing-page.test.tsx           # CREATE or UPDATE - Test button removal
```

**Test Coverage Goals**:

- Landing page component: 60%+ coverage
- Focus on user-visible elements (buttons, headings, links)

**Test Cases**:

1. **Positive Test: Login Button Present**
   - Given the landing page renders
   - When checking for "Login to System" button
   - Then the button should be present and link to `/login`

2. **Negative Test: System Health Button NOT Present**
   - Given the landing page renders
   - When checking for "System Health" button
   - Then the button should NOT be in the document
   - Expectation: `expect(screen.queryByText(/System Health/i)).not.toBeInTheDocument()`

3. **Layout Test: Single Button Centered**
   - Given the landing page renders
   - When checking button container
   - Then container should have `flex justify-center` classes
   - Button should be centered horizontally

4. **Regression Test: Page Heading and Description**
   - Given the landing page renders
   - When checking page content
   - Then heading "HR Masterdata Management System" should be present
   - Description text should be present
   - Version number should be present

**Manual Testing Checklist**:

1. **Desktop View**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Verify "Login to System" button is centered
   - Verify "System Health" button is NOT visible
   - Button should have comfortable width (not too narrow)
   - Hover effect should work (button shade change)

2. **Mobile View** (use browser DevTools responsive mode):
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Set viewport to 375px width (iPhone)
   - Verify "Login to System" button is full-width
   - Button should be easy to tap (44px minimum height)
   - Card layout should be responsive

3. **Health Endpoint Verification**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/health`
   - Verify JSON response appears with status 200 OK
   - Response should include health status data
   - No UI for endpoint - raw JSON acceptable

4. **Link Functionality**:
   - Click "Login to System" button
   - Should navigate to `/login` page
   - No 404 errors or broken links

### Known Issues and Limitations

**No Known Blockers**:

- Straightforward UI change
- No backend modifications required
- Low risk of regression

**Potential Edge Cases**:

- If landing page test file doesn't exist, create it (Task 3)
- Ensure button layout doesn't break on very small viewports (<320px)
