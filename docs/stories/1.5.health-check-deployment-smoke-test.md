## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

[Source: Story 1.4 Completion Notes]

**Story 1.4 established:**

- Complete role-based access control system with proxy pattern
- Proxy function at `src/proxy.ts` with route protection
- API protection helpers: `requireAuthAPI()`, `requireRoleAPI()`, `requireHRAdminAPI()`
- Admin routes at `/admin/*` protected for hr_admin role only
- 403 error page for unauthorized access
- Authentication service and user repositories fully functional
- Session management with 8-hour timeout working

**Key infrastructure ready for deployment:**

- Next.js 14+ application with App Router
- TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui component library
- Supabase Auth integration with session management
- Database schema with users, employees, column_config, important_dates tables
- Row-level security policies configured
- Testing utilities and comprehensive test coverage

**Deployment readiness:**

- Application builds successfully locally (`pnpm build`)
- All authentication flows tested and working
- Protected routes enforced via proxy middleware
- API routes following consistent error response patterns

### Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

**Deployment Platform:**

- Frontend: Vercel Edge Network (automatic CDN)
- Backend: Vercel Serverless Functions (from /app/api/\* routes)
- Database: Supabase hosted PostgreSQL
- Build Command: `pnpm build`
- Deployment Trigger: Push to main branch (automatic via Vercel GitHub integration)

**Vercel Configuration:**

```json
// vercel.json (optional - Vercel auto-detects Next.js)
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "pnpm build",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install --frozen-lockfile"
}
```

**Environment Variables Required in Vercel:**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key for client-side access
- Additional Supabase keys if needed for server-side operations

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#cicd-pipeline]

**CI/CD Workflow:**

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub main branch
2. GitHub triggers Vercel build automatically
3. Vercel builds Next.js application with TypeScript type checking
4. Vercel deploys to edge network
5. API routes deployed as serverless functions
6. Production URL becomes accessible immediately

**Build Process:**

- Type checking: `tsc --noEmit`
- Linting: `eslint .`
- Build: `next build` (creates optimized production build)
- Output: `.next` directory with static and server bundles

### API Health Check Specification

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#health-check]

**Health Check Endpoint:**

```typescript
// app/api/health/route.ts
GET /api/health

Response:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T19:30:00Z"
}
```

**Authentication:** None required (public endpoint)

**Purpose:** System health verification for monitoring and smoke tests

**Implementation Pattern:**

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({
    status: "ok",
    version: "0.1.0",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
}
```

### Landing Page Requirements

[Source: Epic 1.5 Requirements]

**Landing Page Components:**

- Application name: "HR Masterdata Management System"
- Brief description: System overview and purpose
- Link to login page: Navigate to `/login`
- Clean, professional design using Tailwind CSS
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

**Route Protection:**

- Landing page (`/`) must be accessible without authentication
- Ensure proxy matcher excludes `/` from authentication checks

**Design Guidance:**

- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Include branding elements if available
- Simple, uncluttered layout focused on directing users to login
- Optional: Display system version or status indicator

### File Locations and Structure

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**New Files to Create:**

- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` - Health check API endpoint (public)
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Landing page at root route (public)

**Files to Modify:**

- `README.md` - Add production URL and deployment status documentation
- `src/proxy.ts` - Verify matcher excludes `/` and `/api/health` from authentication

**Proxy Matcher Configuration:**

```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: ["/dashboard/:path*", "/admin/:path*", "/api/:path*", "/login"],
};
```

Note: Matcher should NOT include `/` (landing page) or specifically exclude `/api/health` from authentication checks.

### Deployment Verification Checklist

[Source: Epic 1.5 AC 7]

**Smoke Test Scenarios:**

1. **Landing Page:**

   - Load production URL
   - Verify page renders without errors
   - Check browser console for warnings/errors
   - Verify responsive design on mobile/desktop
   - Test navigation to login page

2. **Health Endpoint:**

   - Access /api/health from browser
   - Verify JSON response with correct structure
   - Confirm status: "ok"
   - Verify timestamp is current
   - Verify version matches expected value

3. **Authentication Flow:**

   - Navigate to /login
   - Enter valid test credentials
   - Verify successful login and redirect to dashboard
   - Confirm user role is displayed correctly
   - Test logout and return to landing page

4. **Protected Routes:**

   - Access /admin/\* routes as non-admin user
   - Verify 403 Forbidden page displays
   - Access /dashboard as authenticated user
   - Verify content loads correctly

5. **Database Connection:**
   - Login creates session in Supabase
   - User role fetched from users table
   - Dashboard displays user-specific data
   - No database connection errors in Vercel logs

### Environment Configuration

[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#environment-configuration]

**Production Environment Variables (Vercel Dashboard):**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[project-ref].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[anon-key]
```

**Verification:**

- Variables must be configured in Vercel project settings
- Variables are encrypted at rest in Vercel
- Changes to environment variables require redeployment
- Test variables are correctly loaded by checking Supabase client initialization

### Error Handling and Monitoring

[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

**Production Error Monitoring:**

- Vercel automatically captures runtime errors in serverless functions
- Use Vercel dashboard logs to monitor deployment and runtime issues
- Browser console logs for frontend errors
- For MVP: Console.error logging (Sentry integration post-MVP)

**Common Deployment Issues:**

- Build failures: Check TypeScript errors, missing dependencies
- Runtime errors: Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Authentication issues: Confirm Supabase URL and keys are valid
- Database connection errors: Check Supabase project is running and accessible

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**For Story 1.5 (Health Check Deployment):**

This story focuses on deployment infrastructure and smoke testing. Testing approach is primarily manual verification with minimal automated tests.

**Testing Approach:**

1. **Unit Tests (30%):**

   - Health endpoint response format validation
   - Landing page component rendering
   - Version number consistency

2. **Integration Tests (20%):**

   - Health endpoint accessibility (no auth required)
   - Landing page loads without authentication
   - Navigation from landing to login page

3. **Manual Smoke Tests (50%):**
   - Production deployment verification
   - End-to-end authentication flow in production
   - Database connectivity verification
   - Protected route access verification

**Test Files to Create:**

- `tests/unit/api/health.test.ts` - Health endpoint unit tests
- `tests/unit/pages/landing-page.test.tsx` - Landing page component tests
- `docs/smoke-test-checklist.md` - Manual smoke test checklist (optional)

**Health Endpoint Tests:**

```typescript
// tests/unit/api/health.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";

describe("GET /api/health", () => {
  it("returns status ok", async () => {
    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/health");
    const json = await response.json();

    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(json.status).toBe("ok");
    expect(json.version).toBe("0.1.0");
    expect(json.timestamp).toBeDefined();
  });

  it("does not require authentication", async () => {
    // Test without auth headers
    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/health");
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  });
});
```

**Landing Page Tests:**

```typescript
// tests/unit/pages/landing-page.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import LandingPage from "@/app/page";

describe("Landing Page", () => {
  it("renders application name", () => {
    render(<LandingPage />);
    expect(
      screen.getByText(/HR Masterdata Management System/i)
    ).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("displays login link", () => {
    render(<LandingPage />);
    const loginLink = screen.getByRole("link", { name: /login/i });
    expect(loginLink).toHaveAttribute("href", "/login");
  });
});
```

**Manual Smoke Test Checklist:**

1. ✅ Production URL accessible
2. ✅ Landing page displays correctly
3. ✅ /api/health returns expected JSON
4. ✅ Login page accessible from landing page
5. ✅ Authentication succeeds with test credentials
6. ✅ Dashboard displays after login
7. ✅ Logout returns to landing page
8. ✅ Admin routes protected (403 for non-admin)
9. ✅ No errors in browser console
10. ✅ No errors in Vercel deployment logs

**Test Coverage Goals:**

- Health endpoint: 95%+
- Landing page: 80%+
- Overall story: 70%+ (due to heavy manual testing component)

## QA Results

### Review Date: October 27, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT**

The implementation demonstrates professional-grade code quality with clean, minimal implementations following Next.js and React best practices. All automated components (health endpoint, landing page, proxy configuration) are production-ready.

**Key Strengths:**

- Health endpoint is elegant and minimal - exactly what's needed, nothing more
- Landing page uses proper shadcn/ui components with responsive Tailwind CSS v4 syntax

**Automated Coverage**: 37.5% (3 of 8 ACs)  
**Manual Verification Required**: 62.5% (5 of 8 ACs)  
**Total Coverage**: 100% (appropriate for deployment story)

**Given-When-Then Mapping:**

**AC 1: Health Endpoint**

- **Given** the application is running
- **When** a request is made to `/api/health`
- **Then** it returns `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0","timestamp":"<ISO-8601>"}`
- **Tests**: `health.test.ts` - validates all response fields and formats

**AC 2: Landing Page**

- **Given** a user visits the root URL
- **When** the landing page loads
- **Then** it displays application name, description, login button, and version number
- **Tests**: `landing-page.test.tsx` - validates all content and navigation links

**AC 8: Deployment Documentation**

- **Given** a developer needs to deploy the application
- **When** they consult the README
- **Then** they find comprehensive Vercel deployment instructions with environment variable setup
- **Validation**: Manual review confirms README has complete deployment section

### Security Review

**Status: ✓ PASS - No security concerns identified**

**Findings:**

1. **Public Route Security**: ✓ **EXCELLENT**

   - Root path (`/`) correctly excluded from authentication via proxy matcher
   - Health endpoint (`/api/health`) public as intended (no sensitive data exposed)
   - Protected routes (`/dashboard/*`, `/admin/*`) remain secured
   - No authentication bypass vulnerabilities introduced

2. **Environment Variables**: ✓ **EXCELLENT**

   - Sensitive Supabase keys documented in `.env.local.example` (not committed)
   - README provides clear instructions for Vercel environment variable configuration
   - No hardcoded secrets in codebase

3. **Information Disclosure**: ✓ **ACCEPTABLE**

   - Health endpoint exposes version number (0.1.0) - standard practice for monitoring
   - Landing page reveals application purpose - expected for public-facing page
   - No sensitive system information exposed

4. **Proxy Middleware**: ✓ **MAINTAINED**
   - All existing security patterns from Story 1.4 preserved
   - Role-based access control for admin routes still enforced
   - Session validation logic unchanged

### Performance Considerations

**Status: ✓ PASS - Performance optimal for deployment infrastructure**

**Findings:**

1. **Landing Page**: ✓ **OPTIMAL**

   - Static Site Generation (SSG) confirmed via build output (`○` marker)
   - Zero server-side rendering overhead
   - Fast initial page load for users

2. **Health Endpoint**: ✓ **EXCELLENT**

   - Minimal computation (timestamp generation only)
   - No database queries or external API calls
   - Sub-millisecond response time expected
   - Suitable for high-frequency health checks

3. **Build Performance**: ✓ **EXCELLENT**

   - Compilation time: 7.1 seconds (excellent for project size)
   - All routes correctly optimized (static vs dynamic)
   - No performance warnings in build output

4. **Bundle Size**: ✓ **OPTIMAL**
   - Landing page uses minimal shadcn/ui components
   - Next.js automatic code splitting applied
   - No unnecessary dependencies added

### Deployment Readiness Assessment

**Status: ✓ READY - All automated components production-ready**

**Checklist:**

- ✓ Production build successful (compiled in 7.1s, no errors)
- ✓ All 53 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✓ Environment variable template created (`.env.local.example`)
- ✓ Deployment documentation comprehensive (Vercel step-by-step guide)
- ✓ Health endpoint implemented and tested
- ✓ Landing page implemented and tested
- ✓ Proxy configuration updated for public routes
- ✓ Troubleshooting guide provided in README
- ⚠️ Manual Tasks 4-7 pending (deployment, smoke testing, production URL documentation)

**Risk Assessment:**

- **Deployment Risk**: LOW - Build succeeds, all automated tests pass
- **Integration Risk**: MEDIUM - Database connection and authentication require production verification
- **Rollback Plan**: Standard Vercel rollback (previous deployment retained)

### Testing Coverage Analysis

**Overall Test Quality: EXCELLENT**

**Unit Tests (8 test cases):**

1. **Health Endpoint** (`tests/unit/api/health.test.ts`): 3 tests

   - ✓ Returns status "ok" with 200 response
   - ✓ Returns current timestamp in ISO-8601 format with recency validation
   - ✓ Returns correct JSON structure (status, version, timestamp)
   - **Coverage**: 95%+ (excellent for simple endpoint)
   - **Quality**: Tests validate behavior, not implementation

2. **Landing Page** (`tests/unit/pages/landing-page.test.tsx`): 5 tests
   - ✓ Renders application name ("HR Masterdata Management System")
   - ✓ Displays description with key system information
   - ✓ Login button with correct href (`/login`)
   - ✓ System health link with correct href (`/api/health`)
   - ✓ Displays version number (0.1.0)
   - **Coverage**: 85%+ (excellent for presentation component)
   - **Quality**: Tests verify user-facing content and navigation

**Test Architecture Strengths:**

- Timestamp test validates format AND recency (prevents hardcoded test data)
- Landing page tests verify navigation targets, not just rendering
- Clear test descriptions following BDD style
- Tests are maintainable and focused on observable behavior

**Minor Gaps (Acceptable for MVP):**

- No integration test for health endpoint via HTTP request (unit tests sufficient for simple endpoint)
- No test explicitly verifying health endpoint is publicly accessible (covered by smoke testing)
- No responsive design validation (visual QA during smoke testing)

**Manual Testing (Tasks 4-7):**

- Task 4: Production deployment verification
- Task 5: Database connection from production
- Task 6: Comprehensive smoke test checklist (8+ scenarios)
- Task 7: Documentation of production URL and results

### Files Modified During Review

**None.** No code changes were necessary during review. All implementations are production-ready as committed by the development team.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/1.5-health-check-deployment-smoke-test.yml`

**Gate Decision Rationale:**

While the **code implementation is excellent and production-ready**, the story cannot receive a **PASS** gate until the manual deployment verification steps (Tasks 4-7) are completed. This is appropriate for a deployment-focused story where manual verification is a core requirement.

**Issue Summary:**

- **DEPLOY-001** (Medium): Manual deployment and smoke testing required (Tasks 4-7) before final approval

**Quality Score: 85/100**

- Base score: 100
- Deduction: -10 for medium-severity deployment verification dependency
- Adjustment: -5 for incomplete acceptance criteria (5 of 8 pending manual verification)

**NFR Validation:**

- Security: ✓ PASS
- Performance: ✓ PASS
- Reliability: ✓ PASS
- Maintainability: ✓ PASS

### Immediate Actions Required

Before marking this story **Done**, the development team must complete:

1. **Deploy to Vercel Production** (Task 4)

   - Push code to main branch to trigger automatic deployment
   - Monitor Vercel deployment logs for any errors
   - Verify deployment completes successfully

2. **Verify Production Environment** (Tasks 4-5)

   - Access production URL and confirm landing page loads
   - Test `/api/health` endpoint returns correct JSON
   - Test login functionality from production environment
   - Confirm database connection from production (authentication flow)

3. **Execute Smoke Test Checklist** (Task 6)

   - Landing page loads without errors
   - Health endpoint responds correctly
   - Login page accessible and functional
   - Authentication succeeds with test credentials
   - Dashboard access works correctly
   - Logout functionality verified
   - Admin route protection confirmed (403 for non-admin)
   - No errors in browser console or Vercel logs

4. **Update Documentation** (Task 7)
   - Add production URL to README
   - Document smoke test results
   - Optional: Add Vercel deployment status badge

### Future Recommendations

**For Later Epics (Not Blocking):**

1. **Add Integration Test for Health Endpoint**

   - Create `tests/integration/api/health.test.ts`
   - Test via actual HTTP request (not direct function call)
   - **Effort**: 20 minutes | **Priority**: LOW

2. **Automated E2E Smoke Tests**

   - Consider Playwright for automated smoke testing in Epic 2+
   - Reduce manual verification overhead for future deployments
   - **Effort**: 2-4 hours | **Priority**: MEDIUM (for Epic 3+)

3. **Deployment Monitoring**
   - Add Vercel deployment webhook notifications
   - Consider uptime monitoring service (e.g., UptimeRobot)
   - **Effort**: 1 hour | **Priority**: LOW (post-MVP)

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Complete manual deployment verification (Tasks 4-7)

**Once Tasks 4-7 are completed and documented:**

- Update Task 4-7 checkboxes to [x]
- Document production URL in Task 7
- Add smoke test results to Dev Agent Record or QA Results
- Request re-review or mark as **Ready for Done**

**The code is production-ready.** This CONCERNS gate reflects the incomplete manual verification steps, not code quality issues.

**Story owner decides final status after deployment verification is complete.**
