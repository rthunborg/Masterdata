# HR Masterdata Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Replace fragile Excel-based workflow with secure, scalable web application for employee/candidate masterdata management
- Enable HR to maintain central masterdata repository with full CRUD capabilities
- Provide external parties (Sodexo, ÖMC, Payroll, Toplux) with role-based access to view relevant employee data and manage their own columns
- Eliminate VB script maintenance burden and data synchronization issues
- Achieve zero monthly operational costs through free-tier infrastructure (Supabase, Vercel)
- Deliver real-time data synchronization with <2 second latency
- Support 10 concurrent users managing up to 1,000 employee records initially
- Reduce HR administrative time on data management by 70% within 3 months
- Achieve 100% user adoption within 2 weeks of launch

### Background Context

The HR team currently manages employee and candidate data through an Excel workbook with VB scripts that synchronize data from a central "Masterdata" sheet to department-specific sheets for external parties (Payroll, Sodexo, ÖMC, Toplux). This approach has reached its breaking point, suffering from data consistency challenges, inadequate access control, technical fragility, collaboration friction, and placing undue burden on non-technical HR staff. The system doesn't scale as the organization grows, creates risk of data corruption, and lacks proper security controls for sensitive employee information.

The HR Masterdata Management System will provide a unified spreadsheet-like web interface where HR controls masterdata while external parties see customized views with relevant read-only masterdata fields plus their own editable columns. The solution emphasizes ease of use for non-technical users, leverages modern serverless technologies (Next.js, Supabase, Vercel) to maintain zero running costs, and provides real-time synchronization to eliminate the stale data issues inherent in file-based distribution.

**FR5c:** HR Admin users must be able to maintain a reference calendar of important operational dates (e.g., Stena dates, ÖMC dates by week) visible to all users for scheduling coordination.

**FR6:** The system must provide a unified spreadsheet-like table interface as the primary view for all users displaying employee records with role-based column visibility.

**FR7:** The table interface must visually distinguish between read-only masterdata columns and editable custom columns through clear visual indicators (e.g., background color, icons, or borders).

**FR8:** External party users (Sodexo, ÖMC, Payroll, Toplux) must be able to view specific masterdata fields (determined by HR configuration) as read-only reference data.

**FR9:** External party users must be able to create, edit, and manage their own custom data columns linked to employee records without affecting masterdata or other parties' data.

**FR10:** External party users must be able to organize their custom columns into logical categories (e.g., "Recruitment Team", "Warehouse Team") for better workflow organization.

**FR11:** Changes to masterdata fields by HR Admin must automatically propagate to all external party views in real-time (visible within 2 seconds) without requiring page refresh.

**FR12:** The system must enforce complete data isolation between external parties so that each party can only view and edit their own custom columns, not those of other parties.

**FR13:** HR Admin must be able to configure column-level permissions specifying which roles can view (read-only) and which can edit specific columns through an admin configuration interface.

**FR14:** HR Admin must be able to create new columns, assign them to specific roles, and define whether they are read-only or editable for those roles.

**FR15:** HR Admin must have a "View As" preview mode allowing them to see exactly what each role (Sodexo, ÖMC, Payroll, Toplux) sees in their table interface to verify permissions are configured correctly.

**FR16:** The table interface must provide text-based search functionality that searches across all visible columns for the current user's role.

**FR17:** The table interface must support click-to-sort on any column header with toggle between ascending and descending order.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The HR Masterdata Management System prioritizes **familiarity and simplicity** for users transitioning from Excel. The interface centers on a powerful, spreadsheet-like table that feels immediately comfortable to non-technical users while providing modern web application benefits (real-time sync, role-based security, cloud access). The design philosophy is "Excel without the pain" - preserving the editing paradigms users know while eliminating file distribution, script maintenance, and permission management headaches.

For HR Admins, the system provides additional administrative capabilities through a separate configuration interface that emphasizes visual feedback and preview modes to build confidence in permission settings. The admin experience prioritizes transparency ("show me what Sodexo sees") over complex permission matrices.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Inline Editing**: Click any editable cell to edit in place (similar to Excel), with visual affordance showing editability
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support arrow keys to navigate between cells, Enter to edit, Escape to cancel
- **Column Sorting**: Click column headers to sort ascending/descending with visual sort indicator
- **Search-as-you-type**: Global search box with instant filtering of visible rows
- **Role Preview**: HR Admin can switch views with a role selector dropdown to "View as Sodexo", "View as ÖMC", etc.
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Clear badges, colors, or icons to distinguish read-only vs editable, masterdata vs custom columns, archived vs active employees
- **Minimal Clicks**: Common actions (edit cell, sort, search) require single click or keystroke
- **Responsive Feedback**: Loading states, success confirmations, and error messages appear inline without blocking the interface

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the following screens deliver the PRD values and goals:

1. **Login Screen** - Simple username/password form with role assignment on authentication
2. **Main Data Table View** - Primary workspace showing employee records with role-based columns (all users)
3. **Important Dates Calendar** - Reference calendar showing key operational dates by week/category (all users, HR editable)
4. **Admin Configuration Panel** - Column permission management and user account management (HR Admin only)
5. **Role Preview Mode** - Embedded in main table view, allows HR Admin to toggle between different role perspectives
6. **Add/Edit Employee Modal or Inline Form** - Interface for HR Admin to create new employee records or edit all masterdata fields
7. **User Account Management Screen** - Interface for HR Admin to create/deactivate user accounts and assign roles

### Accessibility

**WCAG AA Compliance** - The system should meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards including:

- Keyboard navigation for all functionality
- Sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
- Focus indicators for interactive elements
- Text resize support up to 200% without loss of functionality

### Branding

**Minimal, Professional, Functional** - No specific corporate branding requirements. The interface should emphasize clarity and usability over visual flair:

- Clean, modern aesthetic using a standard component library (e.g., shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS)
- Neutral color palette with strategic use of color for status indicators
- Clear typography optimized for readability
- Icons used sparingly to support recognition (edit, delete, archive, search, sort indicators)
- Consistent spacing and layout following design system conventions

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive - Desktop Primary** - The application targets desktop browsers as the primary platform with responsive design considerations:

- Optimized for desktop screens (1280x720 and above)
- Horizontal scrolling acceptable for many columns (similar to Excel)
- Responsive down to tablet landscape (1024px) for viewing data
- Mobile phone access not prioritized for MVP (complex table editing is impractical on small screens)
- Modern browser support: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (last 2 major versions)

---

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

**Monorepo** - Single repository containing the full-stack Next.js application with integrated frontend and backend:

- Simplified deployment and version management
- Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend
- Single dependency management (package.json)
- Appropriate for small-to-medium team and project scope

### Service Architecture

**Serverless Monolith with Next.js** - The application will use Next.js App Router with integrated API routes deployed as serverless functions on Vercel:

- **Frontend**: Next.js React components with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes as serverless functions handling business logic and Supabase database interactions
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with real-time subscriptions, row-level security (RLS), and built-in authentication
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for live data updates (alternative: polling fallback if latency issues)

**Rationale**: This architecture maximizes free-tier benefits (Vercel + Supabase), minimizes operational complexity, supports rapid MVP development, and leverages modern serverless patterns for scalability and zero-cost idle periods.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing** for MVP:

- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic functions, utility functions, data transformation logic using Vitest or Jest
- **Integration Tests**: API routes testing with database interactions using test database environment
- **Component Tests**: Critical UI components (table, edit forms) using React Testing Library
- **Manual Testing**: E2E user workflows through UAT with actual users
- **Local Testability**: Backend API routes must be testable via CLI tools (curl, Postman) or test scripts independently of frontend
- **Test Coverage Goal**: 70%+ for business logic, critical paths must have tests

**Deferred to Post-MVP**: Full E2E automation (Playwright/Cypress), visual regression testing, performance testing automation

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enable strict TypeScript configuration for maximum type safety and catching errors early
- **Supabase RLS as Primary Security**: Row-level security policies in Supabase must be the primary enforcement mechanism for data access, not just backend API logic
- **Database Schema Evolution**: Use Supabase migrations for schema changes, version controlled in repository
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration (Supabase keys, API URLs) managed via environment variables, not committed to repository
- **Error Logging**: Implement basic error logging (console for MVP, Sentry or similar in post-MVP) to track production issues
- **Spreadsheet UI Library**: Evaluate TanStack Table first (lightweight, flexible) before considering AG Grid (more features but complex licensing) for the table interface
- **State Management**: Use React hooks (useState, useContext) and Supabase real-time subscriptions for state management; avoid Redux/Zustand unless complexity demands it
- **Data Migration Strategy**: Create a simple import script or admin tool to migrate existing Excel data into database during initial deployment
- **Session Management**: Leverage Supabase Auth for session management with configurable session timeout (suggest 8 hours for balance of security and convenience)
- **Concurrent Edit Handling**: Implement optimistic UI updates with last-write-wins conflict resolution; display warning if user's data is stale (future: operational transform or CRDT)
- **Column Definition Storage**: Store column metadata (name, type, role permissions, category) in a column_config table to support dynamic column management by HR Admin
- **Development Environment**: Use Docker or local Supabase CLI for local development database to match production PostgreSQL environment

2. Clicking a cell enters edit mode: cell becomes an input field (text input for text fields, date picker for dates, dropdown for gender) with current value pre-populated
3. User can modify the value and press Enter or click outside the cell to save
4. Pressing Escape cancels the edit and reverts to original value
5. Save triggers API call to /api/employees/[id] (PATCH) updating the specific field in the database
6. Successful update shows subtle visual feedback (brief highlight or success indicator) and updates the displayed value
7. Update operation validates user role is hr_admin before allowing modification
8. Validation errors (e.g., invalid email format, empty required field) display as inline error message and prevent save
9. Termination Date field is nullable and can be edited to set or clear the value
10. API endpoint is testable via CLI (e.g., curl -X PATCH /api/employees/{id} -d '{"email": "new@example.com"}')
11. Changes are persisted to database and remain after page refresh

### Story 2.4: Archive Employee (Soft Delete)

As an **HR Admin**,  
I want **to archive an employee record so it's hidden from the main view but remains recoverable**,  
so that **I can manage employee lifecycle (departures) without losing historical data**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Each table row includes an "Archive" action button or icon (e.g., archive icon in an actions column)
2. Clicking "Archive" displays a confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to archive [Employee Name]? They will be hidden from the main view but can be recovered later."
3. Confirming archive action calls API route /api/employees/[id]/archive (POST) which sets is_archived = true in the database
4. Archived employee immediately disappears from the main table view
5. Archive operation validates user role is hr_admin before allowing modification
6. Success message displayed: "[Employee Name] has been archived."
7. Archived employees can be viewed by toggling a "Show Archived" checkbox or filter on the dashboard (displays archived employees in a visually distinct way, e.g., grayed out or separate section)
8. Clicking "Unarchive" on an archived employee restores it to active status and returns it to the main table view
9. API endpoint is testable via CLI (e.g., curl -X POST /api/employees/{id}/archive)
10. Archive status persists correctly in database (is_archived column)

### Story 2.5: Mark Employee as Terminated/Drop Out

As an **HR Admin**,  
I want **to mark an employee as "Terminated/Drop out" with termination date and reason**,  
so that **I can track employee departures separately from active employees while maintaining their full record history**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Each table row includes a "Mark as Terminated" action button or option in actions menu
2. Clicking "Mark as Terminated" opens a modal with form fields: Termination Date (required, date picker), Termination Reason (required, text area for comments)
3. Modal displays employee key information for confirmation: First Name, Surname, SSN, Rank, Gender
4. Form includes "Confirm Termination" and "Cancel" buttons
5. Confirming termination calls API route /api/employees/[id]/terminate (POST) which sets is_terminated = true, termination_date, and termination_reason in the database
6. Terminated employee is visually distinguished in the table (e.g., grayed out, struck through, or badge showing "Terminated")
7. Terminated employees can be filtered separately using "Show Terminated" checkbox or filter dropdown
8. Termination operation validates user role is hr_admin before allowing modification
9. Success message displayed: "[First Name] [Surname] has been marked as terminated."
10. Terminated employees can be "reactivated" (setting is_terminated = false, clearing termination_date and reason) if marked in error
11. API endpoint is testable via CLI (e.g., curl -X POST /api/employees/{id}/terminate -d '{"termination_date": "2025-10-26", "termination_reason": "Voluntary resignation"}')

### Story 2.6: Import Employees from CSV File

As an **HR Admin**,  
I want **to import employee masterdata from a CSV file**,  
so that **I can migrate existing Excel data into the system efficiently without manual data entry**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. "Import Employees" button displayed on the dashboard near "Add Employee" button
2. Clicking "Import Employees" opens a modal with file upload component accepting .csv files
3. Modal includes instructions: "Upload a CSV file with the following columns: First Name, Surname, Social Security No., Email, Mobile, Town District, Rank, Gender, Hire Date (YYYY-MM-DD), Comments"
4. After file selection, system validates CSV format and displays preview of first 5 rows with detected columns
5. Column mapping interface allows HR to map CSV columns to database fields (e.g., "Surname" → surname, "Social Security No." → ssn)
6. Validation checks for required fields (First Name, Surname, SSN, Hire Date) and displays errors for missing/invalid data
7. "Import" button processes the CSV, inserting valid employee records into the employees table via API route /api/employees/import (POST)
8. Import progress indicator shows number of records processed (e.g., "Importing 45 of 100 employees...")
9. After import completes, success summary displays: "Successfully imported X employees. Y rows skipped due to errors." with option to download error report
10. Imported employees appear in the main table view immediately
11. Import operation validates user role is hr_admin before allowing execution
12. Duplicate SSN handling: skip row and report as error (no duplicate SSN allowed)
13. API endpoint is testable via CLI (e.g., curl -X POST /api/employees/import -F 'file=@employees.csv')

### Story 2.7: Search and Sort Employee Table

As an **HR Admin**,  
I want **to search employees by any field and sort columns ascending/descending**,  
so that **I can quickly find specific employees in a large list**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Search input box displayed above the employee table with placeholder "Search employees..."
2. Typing in search box filters table rows in real-time (client-side filtering) matching search term against all visible columns (First Name, Surname, SSN, Email, Mobile, Rank, Gender, Town District)
3. Search is case-insensitive and matches partial strings
4. Table displays "No employees match your search" message if search returns no results
5. Clearing search box restores full employee list
6. Each column header is clickable to sort the table by that column
7. First click sorts ascending (visual indicator: up arrow), second click sorts descending (down arrow), third click removes sort (returns to default order)
8. Sort functionality works correctly for text fields (alphabetical) and date fields (chronological)
9. Search and sort work together: search filters the data set, sort orders the filtered results
10. Performance is acceptable for 1,000 employee records (filtering/sorting completes in <500ms)

### Story 2.8: Important Dates Reference Calendar

As an **HR Admin**,  
I want **to maintain a reference calendar of important operational dates visible to all users**,  
so that **everyone can coordinate scheduling around key Stena and ÖMC dates throughout the year**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Navigation includes "Important Dates" link accessible to all authenticated users (HR Admin, external parties)
2. Important Dates page displays a table/calendar view showing dates organized by week number and category (e.g., "Stena Dates", "ÖMC Dates")
3. Table displays columns: Week Number, Year, Category, Date Description, Date Value, Notes
4. For HR Admin: "Add Date" button opens modal with form fields: Week Number (integer, optional), Year (integer, default current year), Category (text or dropdown: "Stena Dates", "ÖMC Dates", "Other"), Date Description (text, e.g., "Fredag 14/2"), Date Value (text for flexible date formats like "15-16/2"), Notes (optional text area)
5. For HR Admin: Inline editing capability to update existing date entries (click cell to edit)
6. For HR Admin: Delete action for each date entry with confirmation dialog
7. Clicking "Save" calls API route /api/important-dates (POST) which inserts record into important_dates table
8. All users (including external parties) can view the important dates in read-only mode
9. Table is sortable by week number and filterable by category
10. RLS policy enforces that all authenticated users can read important_dates but only hr_admin role can create/update/delete
11. API endpoints testable via CLI: GET /api/important-dates, POST /api/important-dates, PATCH /api/important-dates/[id], DELETE /api/important-dates/[id]
12. Important dates persist across sessions and are available immediately after creation
13. Optional: Visual calendar view toggle showing dates in traditional calendar format alongside table view

## Epic 3: Role-Based Column Visibility & External Party Views

**Epic Goal**: Implement the dynamic column permission system and role-based table views so that external parties (Sodexo, ÖMC, Payroll, Toplux) can log in and see customized views showing only the masterdata columns HR has configured for their role. This epic establishes the foundation for isolated data access and prepares for custom column functionality in the next epic.

### Story 3.1: Column Configuration Data Model & Seeding

As a **developer**,  
I want **the column_config table populated with masterdata column definitions and initial role permissions**,  
so that **the system knows which columns exist and which roles can view them**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Database seed script or migration creates entries in column_config table for all masterdata columns: First Name, Surname, SSN, Email, Mobile, Town District, Rank, Gender, Hire Date, Termination Date, Termination Reason, Comments
2. Each column entry includes: column_name (matches database column), column_type (e.g., 'text', 'date', 'email'), is_masterdata (true), category (null for masterdata)
3. ole_permissions field (JSONB) populated with initial permissions structure: { "hr_admin": {"view": true, "edit": true}, "sodexo": {"view": true, "edit": false}, "omc": {"view": true, "edit": false}, "payroll": {"view": true, "edit": false}, "toplux": {"view": true, "edit": false} } for commonly shared columns like Name, Email
4. Some columns (e.g., SSN, Termination Date) configured with restricted view permissions (only HR Admin can view)
5. Seed script is idempotent (can be run multiple times without duplicating data)
6. Column configuration is queryable via API route /api/columns (GET) returning all column definitions
7. API route validates user is authenticated before returning column config
8. Column config API is testable via CLI (e.g., curl /api/columns -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>')

### Story 3.2: Dynamic Table Columns Based on Role Permissions

As an **external party user**,  
I want **to see only the columns I have permission to view when I log in**,  
so that **I'm not overwhelmed with irrelevant data and the interface respects my access level**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Table component fetches current user's role from session and queries column configuration for columns where
   ole_permissions[user_role].view = true
2. Table dynamically renders only columns the user has permission to view (column list varies by role)
3. For HR Admin role, all masterdata columns are visible
4. For external party roles (Sodexo, ÖMC, Payroll, Toplux), only configured-visible columns are displayed (initially: Name, Email, Phone, Hire Date per seed configuration)
5. Columns without view permission are completely absent from the table (not just hidden with CSS)
6. Column order is consistent and follows logical grouping (masterdata columns first, alphabetical or by configuration order)
7. Table header labels use human-readable names (e.g., "Hire Date" not "hire_date")
8. Logging in as different roles shows different column sets (verified through manual testing with multiple role accounts)
9. Performance is acceptable: column filtering and rendering completes in <300ms
10. If a role has zero visible columns (misconfiguration), display error message: "No columns configured for your role. Please contact HR."

### Story 3.3: Read-Only vs Editable Column Visual Indicators

As an **external party user**,  
I want **to clearly see which columns I can edit versus which are read-only**,  
so that **I don't waste time trying to edit fields I don't have permission to change**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Table cells for columns where user has edit: false permission are visually distinguished as read-only (e.g., lighter background color, lock icon, or no hover effect)
2. Table cells for columns where user has edit: true permission show editable affordance (cursor changes to pointer or text cursor on hover, subtle background change)
3. For external parties viewing masterdata columns (read-only), cell click does nothing or shows tooltip: "This field is read-only. Contact HR to update."
4. For HR Admin, all masterdata columns remain editable as implemented in Epic 2
5. Visual distinction is consistent and follows design system (color palette, iconography)
6. Accessibility: read-only state is communicated to screen readers via appropriate ARIA attributes
7. Column headers for read-only columns optionally include a lock icon or badge indicating read-only status
8. User can still select and copy text from read-only cells for reference

### Story 3.4: External Party Login and Dashboard Access

As an **external party user (Sodexo, ÖMC, Payroll, Toplux)**,  
I want **to log in and see the employee table with my permitted columns**,  
so that **I can view current employee masterdata relevant to my work**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. HR Admin can create user accounts for external parties through admin interface (or via database seed for testing) with roles: sodexo, omc, payroll, toplux
2. External party user can log in using their assigned email/password credentials
3. After login, external party user is redirected to /dashboard showing the employee table
4. Table displays only columns the external party has view permissions for (per column configuration)
5. All displayed masterdata columns are read-only (clicking cells shows read-only indicator or no action)
6. External party user cannot access /admin/\* routes (middleware redirects to dashboard or shows 403 error)
7. External party user sees their role name displayed somewhere in the UI (e.g., header: "Logged in as: Sodexo User")
8. Logout functionality works correctly for external party users
9. External party user cannot create, archive, or delete employees (buttons/actions hidden or disabled)
10. Manual testing completed with at least 2 different external party role accounts verifying correct column visibility

## Epic 4: External Party Custom Columns & Real-Time Sync

**Epic Goal**: Enable external parties to create and manage their own custom data columns with category organization, ensuring complete data isolation between parties. Implement real-time synchronization so that masterdata changes by HR Admin instantly propagate to all external party views. This epic delivers the core value proposition of autonomous data management with live updates.

### Story 4.1: Custom Column Definition and Storage Schema

As a **developer**,  
I want **database tables to store custom column data separately per external party with flexible schema**,  
so that **each party can define their own columns without affecting others**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Database tables created for each external party: sodexo_data, omc_data, payroll_data, oplux_data with columns: id (UUID), employee_id (UUID, foreign key to employees.id), data (JSONB), created_at, updated_at
2. RLS policies created on each party-specific table: only users with matching role can read/write their own table (e.g., sodexo role can only access sodexo_data)
3. column_config table supports entries for custom columns with is_masterdata = false and party-specific role permissions
4. Foreign key constraint ensures employee_id references valid employee in employees table with CASCADE delete
5. JSONB data field stores custom column values as key-value pairs (column_name: value)
6. Database migration files version controlled and documented
7. API route /api/custom-columns (GET) returns list of custom columns for current user's role from column_config
8. API route /api/custom-columns (POST) allows creating new custom column definition (role validation enforces only appropriate roles can create columns for their party)

### Story 4.2: Create Custom Column for External Party

As an **external party user**,  
I want **to create a new custom column specific to my role with a name, type, and optional category**,  
so that **I can track data relevant to my department's needs**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. External party dashboard includes "Add Column" button (visible only to external party roles, not HR Admin)
2. Clicking "Add Column" opens modal with form fields: Column Name (required, text input), Column Type (dropdown: Text, Number, Date, Boolean), Category (optional, text input or dropdown with existing categories)
3. Form validation ensures column name is unique for the role (cannot create duplicate column names)
4. Submitting form calls /api/custom-columns (POST) creating entry in column_config with is_masterdata = false,
   ole_permissions set for only current user's role
5. New column appears in the table as a new column header immediately after creation
6. New column cells are empty for all employees initially (null values in JSONB data field)
7. Success message displayed: "Column '[Column Name]' created successfully"
8. External party user can create multiple custom columns (no limit for MVP)
9. Column creation is isolated: Sodexo creating a column does not affect ÖMC, Payroll, or Toplux views
10. API endpoint testable via CLI with appropriate role authentication

### Story 4.3: Edit Custom Column Data

As an **external party user**,  
I want **to click on cells in my custom columns and edit the values**,  
so that **I can populate and maintain my department-specific data**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Custom column cells (columns where current user role has edit: true permission and is_masterdata = false) are visually indicated as editable
2. Clicking a custom column cell enters edit mode with appropriate input type based on column type (text input, number input, date picker, checkbox for boolean)
3. User can enter/modify value and save by pressing Enter or clicking outside cell
4. Save triggers API call to /api/employees/[id]/custom-data (PATCH) updating the JSONB data field in the appropriate party-specific table (e.g., sodexo_data)
5. If no record exists in party-specific table for this employee_id, insert new record with employee_id and data JSONB
6. If record exists, update the specific column key-value in JSONB data field
7. RLS policies enforce that only the matching role can update their party-specific table
8. Successful save updates the displayed value in the table cell
9. Validation errors (e.g., invalid number format, invalid date) display inline and prevent save
10. Other external parties cannot see or edit this custom column data (verified through manual testing with multiple role accounts)
11. API endpoint testable via CLI

### Story 4.4: Organize Custom Columns by Category

As an **external party user**,  
I want **to organize my custom columns into categories**,  
so that **I can logically group related columns for my workflow (e.g., Recruitment Team, Warehouse Team)**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Column configuration includes category field (string, optional)
2. Table view groups custom columns by category with visual separators or subheaders (e.g., "Recruitment Team" subheader above columns in that category)
3. Columns without category appear in an "Uncategorized" or default group
4. External party user can edit column category through a "Manage Columns" interface or edit modal
5. Clicking "Edit Column" on an existing custom column allows changing its name, type, or category
6. Category changes update column_config and table view reorganizes columns immediately
7. Category grouping is cosmetic/UI only (does not affect data storage)
8. Table remains sortable and searchable across all visible columns regardless of category grouping
9. Categories can be reused across multiple columns (e.g., multiple columns in "Recruitment Team" category)

### Story 4.5: Real-Time Masterdata Synchronization

As an **external party user**,  
I want **to see masterdata changes made by HR Admin appear in my view within 2 seconds without refreshing the page**,  
so that **I always have current employee information**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Frontend subscribes to Supabase real-time channel for employees table changes (inserts, updates, deletes)
2. When HR Admin updates a masterdata field (e.g., changes employee name), the change event is received by all subscribed clients
3. Table component updates the affected row automatically with new data within 2 seconds
4. Real-time update maintains current sort and search filters (updated row stays in correct position based on active sort/filter)
5. Visual indicator briefly highlights the updated cell or row (e.g., brief color pulse) to draw user attention to the change
6. New employee insertions by HR Admin appear in all external party tables automatically (if they have permission to view employees)
7. Employee archival by HR Admin removes the employee from external party views in real-time
8. Real-time functionality gracefully degrades if Supabase real-time connection fails (fallback to polling every 5 seconds or display warning message)
9. Real-time sync tested manually: open two browser windows (one as HR Admin, one as external party), verify changes propagate
10. Performance remains acceptable with real-time sync active (no noticeable lag or memory leaks)

## Epic 5: Admin Configuration & Role Preview

**Epic Goal**: Provide HR Admin with comprehensive administrative capabilities including user account management, column permission configuration, and the critical "View As" role preview feature that allows HR to verify what each external party sees. This epic completes the MVP by delivering the admin tooling necessary for HR to confidently manage the system.

### Story 5.1: User Account Management Interface

As an **HR Admin**,  
I want **to create, view, and deactivate user accounts with assigned roles**,  
so that **I can manage access for HR staff and external party representatives**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Admin navigation includes "User Management" link accessible only to HR Admin role
2. User Management page (/admin/users) displays table of all users from users table showing: Email, Role, Active Status, Created Date
3. "Add User" button opens modal with form: Email (required, email format), Password (required, minimum 8 characters), Role (dropdown: hr_admin, sodexo, omc, payroll, toplux), Active (checkbox, default true)
4. Submitting form calls /api/admin/users (POST) which creates user in Supabase Auth and corresponding record in users table
5. Success message displayed: "User [Email] created successfully. Initial password: [password]" (note: in production, password should be sent via email, but manual copy is acceptable for MVP)
6. User table includes "Deactivate" action for active users and "Activate" action for inactive users
7. Deactivating user sets is_active = false in users table and revokes Supabase Auth session (user cannot log in)
8. Activating user sets is_active = true and allows login
9. HR Admin cannot deactivate their own account (validation prevents self-deactivation)
10. User management operations are testable via API routes with hr_admin role authentication
11. Form includes basic validation and displays errors clearly

### Story 5.2: Column Permission Configuration Interface

As an **HR Admin**,  
I want **to configure which roles can view and edit specific columns through a visual interface**,  
so that **I can control data access granularly without writing code or SQL**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Admin navigation includes "Column Settings" link accessible only to HR Admin role
2. Column Settings page (/admin/columns) displays table of all columns from column_config showing: Column Name, Type, Category, Masterdata/Custom, and Permission toggles for each role
3. For each column row, display checkboxes or toggles for each role (HR Admin, Sodexo, ÖMC, Payroll, Toplux) with two states: View, Edit
4. HR Admin role is always View=true, Edit=true for masterdata columns (checkboxes disabled/grayed out)
5. Toggling permission checkbox updates
   ole_permissions JSONB in column_config table via API call /api/admin/columns/[id] (PATCH)
6. Permission changes take effect immediately in all user sessions (real-time or next page load)
7. Interface prevents invalid states (e.g., Edit permission requires View permission - toggling Edit on automatically enables View)
8. Visual grouping or filtering options: "Show only Masterdata Columns", "Show only Custom Columns", filter by role
9. Changes persist to database and remain after page refresh
10. Bulk action option: "Apply to all external parties" checkbox for quick permission setting across Sodexo, ÖMC, Payroll, Toplux
11. Success feedback displayed when permissions updated

### Story 5.3: View As Role Preview Mode

As an **HR Admin**,  
I want **to switch to a preview mode showing exactly what each external party role sees**,  
so that **I can verify column permissions are configured correctly before users access the system**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. HR Admin dashboard includes role selector dropdown in header or toolbar: "View As: HR Admin | Sodexo | ÖMC | Payroll | Toplux"
2. Selecting a role from dropdown switches the table view to display only columns that role has permission to view
3. In preview mode, visual banner or indicator displays: "Viewing as [Role Name] - Preview Mode" with prominent "Exit Preview" button
4. Column visibility, read-only states, and custom columns match exactly what a user logged in as that role would see
5. In preview mode, edit actions are disabled (or simulated read-only) to prevent accidental data modification while previewing
6. Switching between different roles in preview mode updates the table view instantly (client-side rendering)
7. "Exit Preview" button returns HR Admin to their normal view with all columns and edit capabilities
8. Preview mode state is client-side only (does not affect database or other users)
9. HR Admin can test search and sort functionality in preview mode to experience external party workflows
10. Manual testing checklist: verify preview mode matches actual external party login for at least 2 roles

### Story 5.4: Delete/Hide Custom Columns

As an **HR Admin**,  
I want **to delete or hide custom columns that are no longer needed**,  
so that **I can maintain a clean column structure and remove obsolete data fields**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Column Settings page includes "Delete" action for custom columns (is_masterdata = false)
2. Masterdata columns cannot be deleted (Delete button disabled or hidden with tooltip: "Masterdata columns cannot be deleted")
3. Clicking "Delete" on custom column displays confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to delete '[Column Name]'? All data in this column will be permanently removed."
4. Confirming delete removes column definition from column_config and removes column key from JSONB data fields in party-specific tables
5. Deleted column disappears from all user views immediately
6. Alternative "Hide" option: sets column to hidden state (view permission false for all roles) without deleting data, allowing future unhiding
7. Delete action is irreversible (data loss warning included in confirmation dialog)
8. External parties cannot delete columns (only HR Admin has access to this functionality)
9. API endpoint /api/admin/columns/[id] (DELETE) handles column deletion with role validation
10. Audit consideration: deleted columns could optionally be soft-deleted (archived) rather than hard-deleted for data recovery (implementation choice)

### Story 5.5: MVP Smoke Test & Documentation

As an **HR Admin**,  
I want **comprehensive documentation and a smoke test checklist**,  
so that **the system is ready for user acceptance testing and production deployment**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. README.md updated with complete sections: Project Overview, Features, Technology Stack, Setup Instructions, Deployment Guide, User Roles & Permissions
