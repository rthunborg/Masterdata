  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "RLS-first approach with defense-in-depth. Role validation prevents cross-party access. No vulnerabilities identified."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "N+1 query pattern acceptable for MVP (<50 employees) but needs optimization for scale. Response time meets 2-second requirement."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages. Optimistic UI with rollback on errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns. Well-documented code. Type-safe implementation."
