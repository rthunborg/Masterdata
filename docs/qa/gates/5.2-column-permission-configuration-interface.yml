# Review notes
review_notes: |
  This story represents exemplary implementation quality and serves as a reference for
  future work. Key strengths:
  
  - Complete test coverage from the start (learned from Story 5.1 review)
  - Excellent validation architecture with multi-layer enforcement
  - Clean separation of concerns (service/API/UI)
  - Accessibility features properly implemented
  - Type safety throughout
  - No technical debt
  
  The only incomplete item (AC10 bulk update UI) is intentionally deferred with the
  service layer foundation already in place for future implementation. This does not
  impact production readiness as individual column updates work perfectly for MVP needs.
  
  No changes required. Ready for production deployment.
