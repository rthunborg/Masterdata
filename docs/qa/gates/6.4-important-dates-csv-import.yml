nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent security implementation: HR Admin role enforcement via requireHRAdminAPI, RLS policies in database, proper error handling without data leakage, file upload validation, server-side CSV parsing'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Good performance design: Client-side preview limited to 5 rows, batch insert for efficiency, database indexes on week_number/year and category, proper error handling avoids unnecessary retries'
  reliability:
    status: PASS

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent maintainability: Clean separation of concerns (validation utility, service layer, repository pattern), well-structured code following project standards, comprehensive test coverage, clear error messages'
