nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Server-side middleware route protection, bcrypt password hashing in migration, proper session validation, admin actions protected at API level, no client-side auth bypass possible"

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns, well-typed with TypeScript, reusable utility functions (getRoleDisplayName), clear migration documentation, comprehensive integration tests"

# Additional Context
implementation_notes: |
  This story successfully implements external party authentication and role-based dashboard access
  using Next.js 13+ App Router patterns with Supabase SSR. The code quality is excellent:

  - Middleware properly protects routes server-side using cookie-based sessions
  - Role display uses server component preventing client-side auth bypass
  - Test user migration is idempotent with clear dev-only documentation
  - Integration tests cover all role combinations
  - Accessibility considerations included (ARIA labels, screen reader support)

  The CONCERNS gate status is solely due to pending manual QA validation (AC 10), which is 
  appropriate for authentication flows where real user behavior must be verified beyond 
  automated tests. Once manual testing is complete, this should move to PASS status.

risk_assessment: |
  Risk Level: MEDIUM

  Primary Risk Factors:
  - Authentication flows require manual validation to ensure proper login redirect behavior
  - Column visibility must be verified with actual role permissions (database seeded data)
  - Admin route blocking needs browser-based testing to confirm middleware behavior
  - Accessibility compliance requires screen reader testing (cannot be fully automated)

  Mitigation:
  - Comprehensive manual test checklist provided (Tasks 8 & 9)
  - Test user credentials documented in migration
  - Integration tests provide baseline coverage
  - Story clearly documents required manual validation steps

  Post-Manual Testing:
  - If manual tests pass → Risk reduced to LOW, gate status → PASS
  - If issues found → Document, fix, re-test before production deployment
