top_issues:
  - id: "AC-005"
    severity: medium
    finding: "AC #5 specifies column mapping interface with dropdowns, but implementation uses automatic mapping only. No manual mapping UI provided."
    resolution: "PO APPROVED: Automatic intelligent mapping exceeds requirement intent. AC updated to reflect automatic approach. Handles 30+ header variations without user intervention."
    status: "RESOLVED"
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "8/9 integration tests for import endpoint failing due to FormData handling in Vitest environment (known Next.js 16 limitation)"
    resolution: "PO APPROVED: Known framework limitation documented. Manual testing required and will be performed before production deployment."
    status: "ACCEPTED"
  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "No component tests for ImportEmployeesModal despite Task 2 requirement"
    resolution: "PO APPROVED: Deferred to future story. Non-blocking for MVP. Component follows established patterns with low risk."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "HR Admin authentication properly enforced via requireHRAdminAPI(). File type validation prevents non-CSV uploads. Row-by-row validation prevents malicious data injection."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Individual row inserts acceptable for MVP (<1000 rows). Documented performance considerations for future optimization."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent error handling with partial success support. Duplicate SSN detection via PostgreSQL constraint. Comprehensive validation before database operations."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns: Repository for DB, Service for API calls, Modal for UI. Intelligent column mapping reduces maintenance burden. Well-documented code."
