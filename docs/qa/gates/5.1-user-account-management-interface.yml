# Additional Notes
notes: |
  This story establishes the foundation for Epic 5 (Admin Configuration & Role Preview).
  The implementation quality is strong with excellent architectural patterns and proper
  separation of concerns. However, the security gap (missing RLS policies) is a serious
  concern that must be addressed before production deployment.

  The development team correctly implemented atomic rollback on user creation failures,
  which demonstrates good understanding of transaction safety. The self-deactivation
  prevention is also well-implemented at both UI and API levels.

  Test coverage is the primary weakness - only service layer tests exist. Integration
  and component tests are essential for this security-critical functionality.

  Recommended next steps:
  1. Create RLS policies migration (30 min)
  2. Implement integration tests (2-3 hours)
  3. Implement component tests (2-3 hours)
  4. Manual testing validation (1 hour)

  Total estimated remediation time: 6-8 hours

  Once these items are addressed, this story should achieve PASS status and serve as
  a solid foundation for Stories 5.2 (Column Permissions), 5.3 (View As Preview), and
  5.4 (Delete Columns).
