decision_rationale: |
  Story 5.10 demonstrates exceptional implementation quality that exceeds all project standards
  and acceptance criteria. The developer showed mastery of React patterns, internationalization,
  accessibility standards, and comprehensive testing practices.

  Key decision factors:

  1. PERFECT REQUIREMENTS COVERAGE: All 5 acceptance criteria fully met with 100% test coverage

  2. EXEMPLARY CODE QUALITY: Zero errors, zero warnings, clean architecture following all standards

  3. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: 8/8 tests passing with thoughtful edge case coverage including:
     - Radix UI dual-element pattern handling
     - Accessibility testing (ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers)
     - Disabled state handling
     - Custom configuration testing
     - Click event preservation

  4. MINIMAL RISK: Risk score of 99/100 with only very low probability/low impact risks

  5. NFR EXCELLENCE: All non-functional requirements PASS with no concerns:
     - Security: No vulnerabilities, static content only
     - Performance: Zero measurable impact
     - Reliability: All tests passing reliably
     - Maintainability: Clean code, zero technical debt
     - Usability: Fully internationalized, accessible

  6. PROACTIVE EXCELLENCE: Developer created reusable test patterns and handled edge cases
     without prompting

  This implementation is production-ready and serves as a best-practice example for future work.

  No changes or fixes required. Ready for Done.
