nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "RLS policies correctly enforced. API routes properly validate HR Admin role for CUD operations. All authenticated users can read. Service layer has no direct DB access (uses repository). No sensitive data exposure."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Client-side filtering/sorting using TanStack Table is efficient for expected dataset size (100-200 entries). Database queries use proper indexes on week_number and category. No pagination needed for MVP dataset size."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling in repository layer (try-catch with specific error messages). API routes return standard error format. Frontend service handles validation errors with details. Delete confirmation prevents accidental deletion."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization following established patterns. Repository pattern used correctly. Service layer abstraction maintained. Zod schemas for validation. Type safety throughout. Clear separation of concerns."
