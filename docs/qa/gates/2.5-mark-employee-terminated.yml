# Reviewer notes
reviewer_notes: |
  Exceptional implementation quality. This story demonstrates mastery of the established
  patterns from Story 2.4 while adding comprehensive functionality. The terminate/reactivate
  feature is production-ready with no blocking issues.
  
  Key highlights:
  - All 11 acceptance criteria fully met
  - 30 new tests added (repository, service, API integration)
  - Zero security vulnerabilities
  - Excellent performance characteristics
  - Clean, maintainable code following project standards
  
  Minor refactoring performed during review improved code consistency without changing
  behavior. All 226 tests remain passing.
  
  RECOMMENDATION: APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION
