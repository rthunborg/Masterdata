# Implementation highlights
implementation_notes: |
  STRENGTHS:
  - Reusable UnsavedChangesDialog component with proper TypeScript interfaces
  - Leverages React Hook Form isDirty for automatic dirty state tracking
  - Single handleCloseAttempt function handles all close triggers consistently
  - AlertDialog provides WCAG AA accessibility (focus management, ARIA labels)
  - Complete i18n with Swedish/English translations
  - 100% test coverage: 6 unit tests + 8 integration tests, all passing
  
  TESTING:
  - Unit: UnsavedChangesDialog component behavior (6/6 passing)
  - Integration: Add Employee Modal dirty state flows (8/8 passing)
  - Minor act() warnings in integration tests are cosmetic (Radix UI internal updates)
  
  COMPLIANCE:
  - Coding Standards: PASS (proper naming, no anti-patterns)
  - Project Structure: PASS (files in correct locations)
  - Testing Strategy: PASS (appropriate test levels)
  - Accessibility: PASS (WCAG AA compliant)
  
  PRODUCTION READINESS: YES 
  No blocking issues, zero critical/high risks, all ACs met.
