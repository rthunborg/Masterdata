  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Permission checks correctly delegate to role_permissions data structure. Refactored to remove redundant isHRAdmin check, making security enforcement cleaner and more maintainable."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "CSS-only visual changes with no performance impact. Permission checks memoized in useMemo. Tooltip rendered on-demand only."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling with safe fallback to read-only. Backward compatibility maintained with canEdit defaulting to true."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component separation. Well-documented code with clear comments. Future-proof design ready for Epic 4 custom columns."

    - action: "Consider extracting permission logic into a custom hook (useColumnPermissions) in Epic 4 when custom columns are added"
      refs: ["src/components/dashboard/employee-table.tsx:197-203"]
    - action: "The skipped tooltip auto-dismiss test could be implemented with better Radix UI + fake timer setup, but not critical"

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "src/components/dashboard/employee-table.tsx"
    lines: "197-203"
    change: "Simplified permission logic from 'isHRAdmin && config.role_permissions[user?.role]?.edit' to just 'config.role_permissions[userRole]?.edit ?? false'"
    why: "The original logic was redundant and would block Epic 4's external party custom column editing. The role_permissions data structure is the single source of truth for edit permissions."
    how: "Removed isHRAdmin guard and rely purely on role_permissions configuration. Added clarifying comments about current (Epic 3) vs future (Epic 4) behavior. Added nullish coalescing for safety."
    impact: "Makes code future-proof for Epic 4. Tests all still pass. No behavioral change for current Epic 3 scope since masterdata columns have edit:false for all non-HR-Admin roles."
