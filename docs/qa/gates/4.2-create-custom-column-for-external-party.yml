nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Role-based access control enforced at API level (hr_admin blocked from creating custom columns). Backend validation ensures only external party users can create columns. RLS policies from Story 4.1 provide defense-in-depth at database level."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient client-side duplicate validation prevents unnecessary API calls. Optimized refetch pattern using useCallback. JSONB storage for custom column data provides excellent query performance."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling in modal, service, and API layers. Form validation provides immediate user feedback. Modal remains open on errors to preserve user input."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns (UI store, service layer, hooks). Well-documented code with TypeScript interfaces. Reusable patterns consistent with existing codebase (Zustand, React Hook Form, Zod)."
