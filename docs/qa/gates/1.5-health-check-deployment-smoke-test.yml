  - 'Clean, minimal health endpoint implementation following Next.js best practices'
  - 'Professional landing page with proper shadcn/ui component usage'
  - 'Comprehensive deployment documentation exceeds story requirements'
  - 'Test coverage appropriate for story scope (unit tests for automated components, manual tests for deployment)'
  - 'Tailwind CSS v4 syntax correctly used (bg-linear-to-br)'
  - 'Version number consistency across health endpoint (0.1.0), landing page, and README'

testing_assessment:
  - 'Health endpoint: 3 unit tests with excellent coverage (status, timestamp, JSON structure)'
  - 'Landing page: 5 component tests validating all key elements and navigation'
  - 'All 53 project tests passing (100% pass rate)'
  - 'Manual verification approach appropriate for deployment infrastructure'
  - 'Story testing ratio achieved: 30% unit, 20% integration (manual), 50% manual smoke tests'

deployment_readiness:
  - 'Production build successful (compiled in 7.1s)'
  - 'Environment variable template created with clear instructions'
  - 'Vercel deployment steps documented comprehensively'
  - 'Troubleshooting guide provided for common deployment issues'
  - 'Smoke test checklist created for systematic verification'
  - 'All code changes ready for deployment - manual verification steps clearly defined'
