# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Original SQL injection vulnerability (SEC-001) fixed with table whitelist.
      Overly permissive function grants (SEC-002) resolved via service role client.
      3-layer security model: API auth → DB function validation → permission isolation.
      Audit logging captures user_id, timestamp, affected_records.

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      JSONB cleanup sequential across 4 tables, expected <500ms for typical dataset.
      Proper loading states prevent UI freezes.
      No performance anti-patterns identified.
      Future optimization: consider batching JSONB updates.

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Comprehensive error handling (404, 403, 500).
      Fail-soft approach for JSONB cleanup errors.
      Graceful degradation (modal doesn't close on error).
      Defensive programming with null checks and disabled states.

  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      Code quality excellent with clear separation of concerns.
      Well-documented security considerations in migrations.
      Type safety throughout (100% TypeScript).
      CONCERN: Integration tests not executed creates maintenance risk.
      CONCERN: Hide/unhide feature lacks dedicated unit tests.

# Detailed recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Execute integration tests with real Supabase instance'
      refs: ['tests/integration/api/delete-column.test.ts']
      rationale: 'JSONB cleanup is complex operation spanning 4 tables, needs production environment validation'

    - action: 'Verify SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable in all deployment environments'
      refs: ['src/lib/supabase/server.ts:39', '.env.example:14']
      rationale: 'Service role client will fail at runtime if env var missing'

  future:
    - action: 'Add unit tests for hideColumn/unhideColumn service methods'
      refs: ['src/lib/services/column-service.ts:107-143']
      rationale: 'Implemented functionality lacks test coverage'

    - action: "Implement 'Show Hidden Columns' toggle in column settings page"
      refs: ['src/components/admin/column-settings-table.tsx']
      rationale: 'UX enhancement for better visibility of hidden columns (Task 6 incomplete)'

    - action: 'Consider showing affected records count in delete confirmation modal'
      refs: ['src/components/admin/delete-column-modal.tsx:27']
      rationale: 'Would help users understand impact before deletion'

    - action: 'Add rate limiting on DELETE endpoint'
      refs: ['src/app/api/admin/columns/[id]/route.ts:59']
      rationale: 'Prevent abuse if authentication is compromised'
