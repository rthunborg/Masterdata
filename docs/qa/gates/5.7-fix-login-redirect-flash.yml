  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Defense-in-depth with dual-layer auth (middleware + server component). No vulnerabilities introduced.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Positive impact - eliminated unnecessary render cycle. Server-side overhead minimal (~10-50ms).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Middleware acts as first layer, server component as backup. Proper error handling in login form.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean Server/Client component separation. Follows Next.js App Router best practices. Well-documented.'

    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 1
    low: 0
  highest:
    category: 'Implementation'
    risk: 'Middleware bug prevented redirect logic from executing'
    probability: 'High (would occur 100% of time)'
    impact: 'High (story goal would fail)'
    mitigation: 'Fixed during QA review - removed /login from PUBLIC_ROUTES'
    residual: 'Low (fix verified with test execution)'

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: 'Add integration test for middleware redirect behavior'
      refs: ['middleware.ts:51-54']
    - action: 'Add E2E test for complete auth flow (post-MVP)'
      refs: ['tests/e2e/']

refactoring_performed:
  - file: 'middleware.ts'
    change: 'Removed /login from PUBLIC_ROUTES array'
    why: 'Was causing early return that bypassed auth redirect logic for /login route'
    impact: 'CRITICAL - Enables proper redirect for authenticated users visiting /login'

manual_testing_required:
  - 'Login as user, navigate to /login in browser address bar, verify instant redirect with zero flash'
  - 'Test with DevTools Network tab throttled to Slow 3G'
  - 'Verify unauthenticated user can still access login form normally'
