## Risk Details

### TECH-001: Default Locale Change Impact

**Score: 1 (Minimal Risk)**

**Description:**
Changing the default locale from English to Swedish might affect existing users who expect English by default.

**Probability:** Low (1)

- Existing users already have NEXT_LOCALE cookie set
- Only affects first-time visitors
- Expected behavior for Swedish-focused application

**Impact:** Low (1)

- User can easily switch to English with one click
- Both flags are now always visible (improved discoverability)
- No data loss or functional impact

**Mitigation Strategy:**

- âœ… Cookie persistence ensures existing users retain their language choice
- âœ… Both flags always visible makes switching obvious
- âœ… Rollback plan available (simple PR revert)

**Testing Requirements:**

- âœ… Manual testing: Clear cookies and verify /sv redirect
- âœ… Verify cookie persistence across sessions
- ðŸ”„ Production smoke test pending (Task 4.2)

**Residual Risk:** Minimal - Effectively mitigated

---

### TECH-002: Missing Translation Keys

**Score: 2 (Low Risk)**

**Description:**
Missing translation keys could cause placeholder text to appear (e.g., "admin.allColumns" instead of "All Columns").

**Probability:** Low (1)

- All 4 keys verified in both `messages/en.json` and `messages/sv.json`
- Developer tested translation loading
- Build process validates JSON syntax

**Impact:** Medium (2)

- User-facing text would show placeholder keys (unprofessional)
- Does not break functionality but degrades UX
- Easy to spot and fix in production

**Mitigation Strategy:**

- âœ… Code review confirmed all keys present:
  - `admin.allColumns`
  - `admin.masterdataOnly`
  - `admin.customOnly`
  - `admin.configureRolesDescription`
- âœ… Production build successful (validates translation files loaded)
- âœ… Manual verification checklist in Task 2.4 completed

**Testing Requirements:**

- âœ… Build verification passed
- âœ… File review confirmed keys match exactly
- ðŸ”„ Production smoke test (Task 4.2) will verify display

**Residual Risk:** Minimal - All keys verified

---

### TECH-003: Responsive Design Edge Cases

**Score: 1 (Minimal Risk)**

**Description:**
Language toggle might not display correctly on unusual screen sizes or older mobile devices.

**Probability:** Low (1)

- Standard Tailwind breakpoint used (`sm:` = 640px)
- Tested pattern (hidden/inline classes)
- Minimal CSS complexity

**Impact:** Low (1)

- Flags might overlap or text might show/hide unexpectedly
- Does not break functionality (buttons still work)
- Only affects visual appearance

**Mitigation Strategy:**

- âœ… Used standard Tailwind responsive classes (`hidden sm:inline`)
- âœ… Simple CSS (no complex calculations or edge cases)
- âœ… Minimum 44px touch target for accessibility
- âœ… Developer tested responsive behavior in Task 3.2

**Testing Requirements:**

- âœ… Desktop (1920px) - verified both flags with labels
- âœ… Tablet (768px) - verified both flags with labels
- âœ… Mobile (375px) - verified both flags (emoji only)
- ðŸ”„ Production testing on actual devices recommended

**Residual Risk:** Minimal - Standard patterns used

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**None** - No critical risks identified

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**None** - No high risks identified

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

#### TECH-002: Translation Coverage

- âœ… Verify all 4 translation keys exist in both language files
- âœ… Build validation (JSON syntax)
- ðŸ”„ Production smoke test: View column settings page in Swedish/English

#### TECH-001: Default Locale

- âœ… Clear cookies and verify /sv redirect
- ðŸ”„ Production smoke test: New user experience

#### TECH-003: Responsive Design

- âœ… Test at 1920px, 768px, 375px viewports
- ðŸ”„ Production testing on actual mobile devices

---

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

**None** - All identified risks are low and mitigated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- âœ… TECH-001: Mitigated via cookie persistence
- âœ… TECH-002: Mitigated via comprehensive verification
- âœ… TECH-003: Mitigated via standard responsive patterns

### Accepted Risks

**None** - All risks have adequate mitigation strategies

---

## Monitoring Requirements

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

**Week 1 (High Vigilance):**

1. **User Feedback Monitoring**
   - Watch for language confusion reports
   - Monitor support tickets about language switching
   - Track user reports of missing translations

2. **Analytics Tracking**
   - Monitor language toggle click rate
   - Track percentage of Swedish vs English users
   - Measure bounce rate on first visit

3. **Error Monitoring**
   - Watch for translation key errors in logs
   - Monitor for cookie-related issues
   - Track any locale switching failures

**Week 2-4 (Standard Monitoring):**

- Continue analytics tracking
- Review user feedback weekly
- No special monitoring needed if Week 1 is clean

---

## Risk Review Triggers

Re-assess risk profile if:

- User feedback indicates language confusion
- Missing translation keys discovered in production
- Responsive design issues reported on specific devices
- Browser compatibility issues arise
- next-intl library updates introduce breaking changes

---

## Rollback Plan

**Low-Risk Rollback Available:**

If critical issues arise in production:

1. Revert PR with 11 file changes
2. Vercel auto-deploys previous version
3. Total rollback time: **< 5 minutes**
4. No database migrations to rollback
5. No API breaking changes

**Rollback Criteria:**

- Critical translation issues affecting business operations
- Majority of users unable to switch languages
- Unexpected locale-related errors

---

## Additional Notes

### Positive Risk Factors

- âœ… Well-scoped hotfix (clear requirements)
- âœ… Comprehensive testing (9/9 tests passing)
- âœ… Zero build errors or warnings
- âœ… Simple changes (config + translations + component)
- âœ… Established patterns (next-intl is battle-tested)
- âœ… Good rollback plan

### Risk Mitigation Highlights

- Developer proactively fixed technical debt
- Created reusable test utilities
- Comprehensive manual testing checklist
- Production validation plan in place (Task 4.2)
